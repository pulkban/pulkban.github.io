  "question": "36 of 60. A sales rep (John) at Universal Containers requested to update information in an account record where he has Read-Only access. John requested the Edit access permission from the owner of the record (Paul). Paul manually shared the record with John. Assuming the organization-wide default of the Account object is Public Read-Only, what is the impact in the system?",
  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Existing AccountShare record is updated. Row Cause is \"Manual\" and Access Level is \"Read/Write\".",
    "B": "New AccountShare record is created. Row Cause is \"Manual\" and Access Level is \"Read/Write\".",
    "C": "New AccountShare record is created. Row Cause is \"Owner\" and Access Level is \"Full\"."
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Manual sharing creates a new AccountShare record with 'Manual' RowCause. OWD is Public Read-Only, so manual sharing grants explicit Read/Write access.",
},
{
  "question": "37 of 60. Universal Containers (UC) operates worldwide, with offices in more than 100 regions in 10 different countries, and has established a very complex Role Hierarchy to control data visibility.

  "options": {
    "A": "Partition data using Divisions",
    "B": "Skinny table",
    "C": "Deferred Sharing Recalculation"
  },

},
{
  "question": "38 of 60. Universal Containers (UC) delivers training and courses to students and companies. UC is implementing a Salesforce Customer Community for its students granting them a Customer Community license.

  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Apex sharing to share cases with the students.",
    "B": "Create a sharing rule to share cases with the students.",
    "C": "Create a sharing set to share cases with the students."
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Sharing sets automatically grant access to account-related cases for community users. Apex sharing (A) requires custom code, while sharing rules (B) don't support account-based sharing for communities.",
},
{

The company also has a large number of customer service representatives who takes calls from customers on company issued desktops and uses case object to track customer issues and grievances. The company would like to capture images of customer site captured by field consultants while they are editing the case record during customer site visit. The Director of IT wants to minimize customization and promote reuseability of code artifacts wherever possible. What recommendations should an architect give to the company to implement the image capture requirement, while ensuring customer that the service rep can continue to use same lightning pages they were trained to use?",
  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Lightning Component as an override for \"Edit\" action on mobile view allowing image capture feature. No Change required for desktop users.",
    "B": "Use Lightning Component as an override for \"Edit\" action on lightning experience allowing image capture feature. Detect the form factor of the device and redirect the user to the default not overridden view.",
    "C": "Create a separate button \"Edit in Mobile\", which opens a custom lightning component that will allow field consultants to add an image. No change required for desktop users."
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Option A provides a mobile-specific solution without affecting desktop users. It meets the requirement for minimal customization while maintaining the existing desktop experience.",
},
{
  "question": "40 of 60. Universal Containers (UC) is a non-profit organization with more than 20,000,000 members (donors).

The donation reps started to see significant degradation of the system performance. What is the reason for this problem?",
  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "There is an Account ownership data skew problem.",
    "B": "The donations repsâ€™ access to the assigned accounts is wrong.",
    "C": "Salesforce sharing recalculation kicked off."
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Ownership skew occurs when users own disproportionate records (50,000+ donors). This strains sharing calculations and query performance. Access (B) and sharing recalculations (C) are symptoms, not root causes.",
},
{
  "question": "41 of 60. A company intends bring work from anywhere culture in a bid to improve productivity. Their sellers use wide variety of devices with different form factors. The company currently uses one page layout to display opportunity record details to the sellers.

  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use a custom LWC override for Opportunity view action, identify form factor onLoad action and display relevant layouts based on form factors.",
    "B": "Use a visualforce override for Opportunity view action, identify the form factor onLoad action and display relevant layouts based on form factors.",
    "C": "Use Dynamic Form to define different field sections applicable for different form factors of devices."
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Dynamic Forms is the native solution for responsive layouts across devices. LWC/VF overrides (A/B) are overengineering for this UI alignment issue.",
},
{
  "question": "42 of 60. Universal Containers (UC) uses a custom Lightning component with an Apex class to display shipment information (custom object, Private organization-wide default). UC sales managers are complaining about two important points: Shipment records that belong to their teams can be seen by other users. Shipment amount should be visible only by managers, but sales reps are able to view it. Which feature did the development team miss that is causing the problems?",
  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use isShareable keyword in Apex classes to assure record visibility.",
    "B": "Use isAccessible() method in Apex classes to check field accessibility.",
    "C": "Use runAs in test class to enforce user permissions and field level permissions."
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The team missed field-level security checks using isAccessible() for the amount field. Record visibility issues require sharing settings, not isShareable (A). runAs (C) is for testing, not runtime security.",
},

    "B": "Add the auditors to the default Opportunity Team.",
    "C": "Put the auditors at the highest level of the Role Hierarchy."
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Criteria-based sharing rules automatically grant access to high-value opportunities for the auditors' public group. Role Hierarchy (C) would grant excessive access, and Opportunity Teams (B) require manual maintenance.",
},
{
  "question": "45 of 60. What should an architect recommend to make sure that users that gained access to a custom object record through Apex managed sharing do not lose access to it when its owner is changed?",
  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use \"With Sharing\" keyword to make sure record visibility will be considered.",
    "B": "Create a new record in _Share object with RowCause \"Manual\".",
    "C": "Create a specific Apex Sharing Reason for the custom object."

},
{
  "question": "46 of 60. Universal Containers has implemented Customer Community with Customer Community Plus licenses for its distributors. Some distributors requested granting specific community users (agents) to view cases submitted by other agents of the same distributor. Which feature only supports these requirements?",
  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Permission set to grant community admin permission",
    "B": "Delegate external user",
    "C": "Partner super user"
  },
  "answer": "C",

  "type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Classic Encryption to ensure all fields are protected and contact Salesforce for help with encryption verification.",
    "B": "Use Encryption Policy and wait for an email from Salesforce indicating the field values are encrypted.",
    "C": "Use Encryption Policy and contact Salesforce to update the existing records so that their field values are encrypted."
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Encryption Policy (Platform Shield) is required for standard fields like Billing Street. Salesforce must retroactively encrypt existing data, while new entries auto-encrypt."

{
  "question": "49 of 60. A custom ServiceFeedback object is used to collect partner feedback. ServiceFeedback records should be available to all internal employees.
