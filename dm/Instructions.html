DEVI MAHATMYAM PARAYANAM DETAILS<br>
<br>
Devi Mahatmyam parayanam can be done in few different ways. <br>
<br>
<h2 class="card-header display-4">1.	Sampoorna parayanam<br></h2>
In this, we recite the entire Devi mahatmyam at a stretch on a single day. It takes around 2.5 hours to complete the parayanam (For first few times, it may take 3 – 3.5 hours too). The order in which it should be read is :<br>
Devi kavacham -> Argala stotram -> Keelakam ->All 13 DM chapters -> Devi sooktham -> 3 rahasyams(optional) -> Kshama prarthana<br>
<br>
<h2 class="card-header display-4">2.	7 day parayanam<br></h2>
This has to be done in 7 consecutive days. The order will be :<br>
Day 1 – kavacham, argala, keelakam, Chap 1, sooktham, kshama <br>
Day 2 – kavacham, argala, keelakam, Chap 2,3, sooktham, kshama <br>
Day 3 – kavacham, argala, keelakam, Chap 4, sooktham, kshama<br>
Day 4 – kavacham, argala, keelakam, Chap 5,6,7,8, sooktham, kshama<br>

Day 7 – kavacham, argala, keelakam, Chap 12,13, sooktham, kshama<br>
<br>
<h2 class="card-header display-4">3.	3 day parayanam<br></h2>
This has to be done in 3 consecutive days – one charithram on each day. The order will be :<br>
Day 1 – kavacham, argala, keelakam, Chap 1, sooktham, kshama<br>
Day 2 – kavacham, argala, keelakam, Chap 2-4, sooktham, kshama<br>
Day 3 – kavacham, argala, keelakam, Chap 5-13, sooktham, kshama<br>
<br>
<h2 class="card-header display-4">Devi Sthuthi</h2>
4.	For those who are not able to recite the entire devi mahatmyam, you can recite the saaram. It is a collection of important segments in DM. This saaram is called Devi Sthuthi. The order will be :<br>
Dhyana sloka Chap 1, 2 and 5<br>
Vishveshwari/Mahamaya stuthi – Chap 1 – sloka 7 – 87<br>
Shakradhi/Mahishahantri stuthi – Chap 4 – sloka 1 - 27<br>
Vishnumaya stuthi – Chap 5 – sloka 9 – 82<br>
Narayani stuthi – Chap 11 – sloka 3 – 35<br>
Kshama prarthana<br>
<br>
<h2 class="card-header display-4">Devi Saptashloki</h2>
5.	For those who cannot do Devi stuthi parayanam as given in 4, you may recite Durga Sapthashloki to get the benefits of reading the entire DM.<br>
<br>
<h2 class="card-header display-4">Few points to note :<br></h2>
1.	Once you start the parayanam, don’t get up from that place until you finish.<br>
2.	Don’t stop recitation in the middle of the chapter at any cost. If so, then you have to start reciting that chapter from the beginning again.<br>
3.	Try to avoid eating/drinking (even water)/talking in the middle of the chapter.<br>
4.	At the end of parayanam, neivedhyam may be offered to Ambaal.<br>
5.	If possible, give thamboolam to any sumangali on that day.<br>
6.	Last but not the least, keep your mind focused without any distraction from outside thoughts. Enjoy your recitation. During the parayanam time, mind conversation happens between you and Her. Feel it and enjoy the bliss. <br>
