						<li>which method u can use to avoid (ans escapeSingleQuotes)<br>
						<li>bind variable - does it help for vulnerability (ans: instead of using ....where firstname = \"+var+\", USE rather :where firstname = :var1 - this way you can avoid falling in trap of 'test LIMIT 1')<br>
						<li>cross site requ forgery - explain (ans u r in BankA - from there u go site 2 by clicking a link - site 2 can acquire that token and do some txns on ur behalf in BankA)<br>
						<br>
						======================================BATCH APEX<br>
						<li>what does start do? (ans get all recs on which the processing has to happen)<br>

						<li>typical structure on how batch executes? (ans <br>
							inStart-getAllRecs; <br>
							execute-listIsThere - loopThro - typeCastEachObject - uKnowWhichOne - doWork - dont worry - just use Database.update(lstCustToUpdate);<br>
							finish-U Have Database.batchableContect bc - bc.GetJobId - getAll from AsyncApexJob where id= :BC.getJobId - send email<br>

						<h3 class="card-title">Visual Force</h3> <p class="card-text"> <small> 
							===Visual Force<br>
							<li>Why is VF called component-based UI framework (ans customTags that include n HTML tags with its placing - tag-based markup language)<br>
							<li>Is VF MVC - so what? (ans front end folks can work separately and so backend controller folks - not tightly coupled)<br>
							<li>How about VF integration (ans u can do with HTML CSS Ajax jQuery!!!<br>
							<li>multiple places to create vf page (ans just say...com/apex/u1 - vf created; setUp-&gt;VF Pages; DevConsole - New VF Page)<br>
							<li>how many types of vf tags (ans 7 - input, select, form, action, Style;  Output, Page)<br>
							<li>Similar to &lt;html&gt;- whats the first basic tag in vf (ans &lt;apex:page&gt;<br>
							<li>first set of page tags? (ans: page, pageblock, pageblocksection, pageblocksectionitem)<br>
							<li>tag for button (ans apex:commandbutton value="s")<br>
							<li>button to appear top and bottom both (ans enclose in apex pageblock buttons)<br>
							<li>whats mandatory for button to appear (ans apex:form)<br>
							<li>where do u see different severity codes (ans apex:pageMessage error,info,warning,confirm)<br>
							<li>every single cell - what is the corresponding tag in VF (ans apex:outputText equivalent to td)<br>
							<li>equivalent for &lt;table&gt; in VF (ans apex:panelgrid - attributes: columns id border)<br>
							<li>tag for tabs? (ans apex:tabpanel and apex:tab)<br>
							<li>everytime you switch between tabs should not call server and page refresh - how? (ans: switchtype="client")<br>
							<li>&lt;a&gt; anchor tag equivalent (ans: apex:outputLink)<br>
							<li>if inputText - whats the mandatory enclosing tag (ans apex:form)<br>
							<li>HTML button's onClick in VF? (ans &lt;apex:commandButton value="save" action"doThis()"&gt;<br>
							<li>save and quicksave (stadard methods) - difference (ans quickSave will stay in same page; save can go to detail screen or list view)<br>
							<li>standard object has standard controllers - how about custom objects? (ans custom objects also have standard controllers)<br>
							<li>typical actions / eventHandlers in standard controllers? (ans save, quickSave, edit, delete, cancel, list(default: recentViewed)<br>
							<li>how do you refer account's name in vf (ans &lt;apex:inputText value="{!account.name}" /&gt;<br>
							<li>how do you update a record in vf - the id context? (ans in URL - queryString ?id=a025j00000FzRjk)<br>
							<li>delete button does not appear for standard controller opp - why? (ans you havent yet fetched opp details for an id)<br>
							<li>standard Save will take to details of acc/cont/opp; If you delete a record using std controller delete - where it goes (ans it will open the main tab of that object)<br>
							<li>vf - list - how to associate the list to that list page (ans apex:page stdControl="Account" recordsetVar="lstAccounts")<br>
							<li>vf pageBlockTable - how to put forEach (ans [[value="{!lstAccounts}" var="a"]] then put apex:column = {!a.Name})<br>
							<li>when you make listview picklist - how to populate all views - which standard variable u use? (ans: value="{!listviewoptions}" for apex:selectOptions tag)<br>
							<li>like column inside the pageBlockTable, whats inside dataList (ans: outputText, inputText - you can put anything)<br>
							<li>diff between inputField and inputText to show a table's field (ans Field will retain based on datatype be it dropdown / date etc - for a picklist value if you put inputText - the value alone will be displayed)<br>
							<li>when to write custom controller (ans when you want to run VF in system mode - that you dont wanna enforce permissions / FLS of the current user)<br>
							<li>custom controller means (ans complete skip of std controller - u write from scratch)<br>
							<li>controller extension (ans whatever present in std/custom controller is there - u add some more features)<br>
							<li>does controller extension respect the permission/fls/sharingR of user (ans yes and no. Yes, when it extends from std controller - No, if extends from custom controller)<br>
							<li>in title if I have to say Welcome &lt;user.firstname&gt; (ans: title="Congratulations {!$User.Firstname}" DOLLLAR for system variables) <br>
							<br>
							<li>can I have duplicate methods in 2 extensions? will it err? (ans No - whichever method it encounters first, it will pickup)<br>
							<li>In Extension class - tell the argument for the constructor method (ans it is ApexPages.StandardController)<br>
							<li>When doing extensions how to get the record in the context (ans ApexPages.StandardController.getRecord());<br>
							<li>Single/ mulitple record - how many controllers are there (ans 4 - stdController / stdListController; customController / custListController)<br>
							<li>Account to Vendor - was master-detail - for some reason, can I change to lookup - it is not allowing why? (ans there is a rollup field in acc)<br>
							<li>while deploying to prod - coverage for apexCode and Trigger (ans apexCode=75%, trigger=1%)<br>
							<li>how do u write unitTests for APEX's private mthod (ans use TestVisible annotation)<br>
							<li>if a VF has multiple pages/wizard - user input comes across pages - how do u mimic in ur unit test (ans Test.setCurrentPage(pageRef) - then use ApexPages.currentPage... etc)<br>
							<li>I write an Apex class to display accounts - PSRs tell they see accounts which they dont own also (ans write class With Sharing keyword)<br>
							<li>Polymorphic field example (not method) (ans who relationship of the task can be a contact / lead/ account?)<br>
							<li>if 2 triggers are there for account object beforeInsert? (ans no guarantee on order)<br>
							<li>just by using string - how to dynamically create class (ans str='public class...' - sforce.create(classes))<br>
